Restful API for managing a library. 

This project was done for studying purposes.

The application's back-end was done with Java + Spring, I also used docker to provide a instance of Postgres.

This app also has a front-end, which is available at [Leo's github](https://github.com/leonardo-earruda).

[Pietro](https://github.com/pietroow) guided us during the project, applying agile methods and reviewing all the code wrote.
